1.This project is my master's thesis, 
which aims to explore high-performance interfacial seawater evaporation technology.

2.City University of Hong Kong has a COMSOL license, and the entire simulation 
analysis process is implemented by COMSOL.Data analysis was performed using 
Matlab and Python (CityU HK also holds the relevant licenses for these software).

3.The purpose of creating this project is to enhance my own learning and 
improvement of COMSOL multi-physics field thermal and moisture coupling 
simulation. There are no other commercial purposes or conflicts of interest.
