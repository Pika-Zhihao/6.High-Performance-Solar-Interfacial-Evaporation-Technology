1.This project is my master's thesis, 
which aims to explore high-performance interfacial seawater evaporation technology.

2.City University of Hong Kong has a COMSOL license, and the entire simulation 
analysis process is implemented by COMSOL.

3.The purpose of creating this project is to enhance my own learning and 
strengthening of fluid-structure interaction simulation, and there is no other commercial purpose or conflict of interest.
